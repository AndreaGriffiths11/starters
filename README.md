# ðŸ‘‹ Meet the Noops

Hi there! The Noops are 20 amazing machines that do nothing useful. Absolutely useless.

So it's time to have a little fun with code and see what we can do with the Noops.

Here are some libraries to help you get started.

## ðŸ§  Data
In our starters, we use the `fetch` standard with the [Github polyfill](https://github.github.io/fetch/). Learn how to use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

## ðŸŽ¨ Drawing

The `canvas` tag is the easiest way to draw with HTML and JavaScript. Learn about the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial).


## ðŸ“š Graphics libraries

`p5.js` is based on Processing, and has a rich set of tools for creating graphics. https://github.com/processing/p5.js

`paper.js` is a set of helpers for creating vector graphics in canvas. https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js

`createJS` is a suite of helpers for drawing, audio, and animation:  https://github.com/createjs

`three.js` lets you create 3D experiences in your browser. https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js

`fabric.js` helps you make canvas elements clickable. https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js

## Animation libraries

`popmotion pure` JavaScript animation. https://github.com/Popmotion/popmotion

## ðŸ•´ Misc
`stats.js` is a handy tool for monitoring your FPS performance if you're running a lot of animations. https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js
